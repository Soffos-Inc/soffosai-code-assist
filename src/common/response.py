To create a Soffos AI service that scores an answer using their SDK, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Install the Soffos AI SDK: Start by installing the Soffos AI SDK in your development environment. You can find the installation instructions in the Soffos AI documentation.\n\n2. Import the necessary modules: In your Python script, import the required modules from the Soffos AI SDK. Typically, you will need to import the `soffosai` module and the specific service module you want to use, in this case, the `AnswerScoringService`.\n\n3. Set up the API key: Set your Soffos AI API key by assigning it to the `soffosai.api_key` variable. You can obtain your API key from the Soffos AI platform.\n\n4. Create an instance of the service: Create an instance of the `AnswerScoringService` class from the Soffos AI SDK. This will allow you to use the service's methods.\n\n5. Call the service method: Use the instance of the service to call the appropriate method. In this case, you would call the `AnswerScoringService()` method and pass in the required parameters such as the user ID, context, question, user's answer, and the 
correct answer.\n\n6. Process the output: The service method will return the scoring output as a dictionary. You can access the score, reasoning, cost, charged character count, and unit price from the output dictionary.\n\nHere's 
an example code snippet that demonstrates the above steps:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport soffosai\nfrom soffosai import SoffosAIServices\n\nsoffosai.api_key = \"<your api key>\"\nservice = SoffosAIServices.AnswerScoringService()\n\noutput = service(\n    user=\"client_user_id\",\n    context=\"Genetic evidence suggests that dogs descended 
directly from wolves (Canis) and that the now-extinct wolf lineages that produced dogs branched off from the line that produced modern living wolves sometime between 27,000 and 40,000 years ago. The timing and location of dog domestication is a matter of debate. There is strong genetic evidence, however, that the first domestication events occurred somewhere in northern Eurasia between 14,000 and 29,000 years ago.\",\n    question=\"How long ago did dogs first become domesticated?\",\n    user_answer=\"around 20,000 years ago.\",\n    answer=\"Between 14,000 and 29,000 years ago.\"\n)\n\nprint(json.dumps(output, indent=4))\n```\n\nThis code sets up the Soffos AI SDK, creates an instance of the `AnswerScoringService`, and calls the service method with the required parameters. The output is then 
printed as a JSON string.\n\nMake sure to replace `<your api key>` with your actual Soffos AI API key.\n\nI hope this helps you create a Soffos AI service that scores an answer using their SDK. Let me know if you need any further
